## Course objective

This is a course in advanced data analysis. Based on the theory of
linear models covered in S431, this course will focus on applying many
types of data analysis methods to interesting datasets. The focus will
be dealing with and describing data rather than on particular methods
per se.

The course combines analysis with methodology and
computational aspects. It treats both the ``art'' of understanding
unfamiliar data and the ``science'' of analyzing that data in terms of 
statistical properties. The focus will be on practical aspects of methodology and intuition
to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and
approaches to problems in their own lives. 

I expect that the material should be appropriate and interesting to
students coming from either statistics or informatics/computer
science. I will make an effort to provide necessary background so that
lectures are accessible to both populations.

We will put special emphasis on learning to use certain tools common to companies which actually _do_
data science. This includes [Slack](https://stat-s432-sp17.slack.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/STATS-432Sp2017), [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com), and [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). As such, we will
require the use of these technologies.

## Lectures

Class time will consist of a
combination of lecture, discussion, questions and answers, and problem
solving, with a focus on problem solving. You are strongly encouraged
to bring a laptop to class.

## Textbook

The required textbook for this class is still
in progress, but is excellent. Download it somewhat regularly, as it
is still being updated.

## Grading

10 Reading responses (10 points each)  
8 Homeworks (40 points each)  
1 Midterm project report (100 points)  
1 Final project report (200 points)  
1 Midterm exam (100 points)  
1 Final exam (200 points)

In all cases, a fixed number of points may be __earned__ for each
exercise. Points are not deducted for poor performance in this
class. Points are awarded for excellent performance.

## Course communication

This class will use [Slack](https://stat-s432-sp17.slack.com/) for class communication. Slack is a Team messaging
app which is frequently adopted by companies and research groups. We will use it for announcements, questions, 
homework communication, etc. You are required to use it. 

Since homework and the project are team-based, you need a way to communicate with your team. Slack is that way. You can
create a special channel for your team. You can direct message individuals. You can message me or the TA. You can post
pictures of cats. The sky is the limit. By using slack, we will avoid sending lots of email back and forth.

Slack has apps for iPhone or Android. Or you can use the web (as I do).

If you send me email instead, I may ignore it.

## Project

You will be required to complete a team project (2-3 people). You may
choose this group. The goal
is to analyze a dataset in depth using everything that you have learned.


A Midterm Report is due on __Thursday, March 9__ at 11:59pm. This report must include your group members, the questions you are interested in, and
evidence that you have successfully loaded the data onto your computer
in processable form. 

The entire class will give brief presentations during the last day of class. 
You will also be graded on your completed
project. You will also submit a final report due on __Thursday, April 27__ at 11:59pm.
